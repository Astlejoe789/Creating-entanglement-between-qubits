## Definition:

  The Controlled NOT gate (CNOT) is a fundamental quantum logic gate used in quantum
  computing that performs a conditional operation. It operates on two qubits: a control qubit
  and a target qubit. It can be used to entangle and disentangle Bell state

## RESULT:

###   CNOT gate truth table is verified using IBM Qiskit tool and compared with
###    theoretical calculation.
###   Simulation and visualization of CNOT gate operations are also done through IBM
###    Qiskit tool.
